### ERP Data Setup

- For this project, we leveraged Azure Platform as a Service (PaaS) SQL Database as our Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system.
- To populate our ERP system with realistic and comprehensive data, we utilized the Adventure Works Sample Database, a well-known and feature-rich dataset provided by Microsoft.
- This sample database offers a wide array of business scenarios and data structures, making it an ideal choice for our project's requirements.
- Please follow the detailed instructions provided below to replicate our setup and ensure a smooth implementation of the Azure PaaS SQL Database with the Adventure Works Sample Database as your ERP foundation.
- will come back to provide the steps for replicating the database
